This is version 7.0 of UniFi driver software for Linux and other
embedded systems, which is designed to work with the UniFi(tm) family
of chips.

The software includes a complete Linux driver and firmware for UniFi-1.
It is not compatible with earlier versions of firmware.

The software is compatible with versions 2.6 of the Linux kernel.
It provides a reference implementation for a UniFi driver and may be used as
the basis for developing a driver for other platforms.

For information on installing and using the driver on a Fedora Core 5 or 6
Linux system, see the INSTALL.fc file and the UniFi Linux User Guide for this
