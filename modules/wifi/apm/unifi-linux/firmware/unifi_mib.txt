                     <event> is one of the following:

             If a particular (state, event) combination appears multiple times

                 1 - AIO used to decouple a UF105x internal voltage reference;
                     a capacitor should be connected between this pin and
                     ground as described in the UF105x data sheet.  On UF602x
                     ICs this option is not supported and should not be used.

                 2 - AIO used as an external slow clock input.  On UF105x ICs
                     this option can only be used for AIO[2].  It should be
                     used if and only if the 'unifiExternalSlowClock' MIB

                 3 - AIO connected to the power detector output from an
                     external 2.4GHz PA, and to be used as the feedback
                     mechanism when performing transmit power control for
                     that band.  In combination with settings in
                     unifiUF602xTxPowerTable and

                     UniFi to calibrate transmit power such that actual output
                     power is constant over temperature and frequency.

                     on UF105x ICs.  This option can only be used for AIO[1],
                     and should be used in combination with

                     ICs this option is not supported and should not be used.

                 5 - AIO connected to a PA feedback line.  When transmitting
                     at high power levels, the voltage on the feedback line
                     of an external PA can be excessive if not loaded.  If

                     (see the description of 3 above) then this line will be
                     suitably loaded, however if PA feedback is connected
                     but is not used then this setting should be selected.

                 6 - AIO connected to the bias control of an external 2.4GHz
                     PA.  This AIO will be driven with a voltage (which is
                     configurable per band, power level and modulation through

                     option is ignored and should not be used.

                 7 - AIO connected to the power detector output from an
                     external 5GHz PA, and to be used as the feedback
                     mechanism when performing transmit power control for

             It is possible to use UniFi with a crystal that does not
             meet the accuracy requirements of the IEEE 802.11
             standard over temperature as long as the crystal's
             behaviour is consistent.  This table allows the crystal
             frequency trim to be changed with temperature to
             compensate for the crystal's inaccuracy.

             Each row of the table specifies a temperature and a trim
             value.  The temperature values are approximately in
             degrees Celsius, the test utility that should be used
             to generate this table can be used to return the
             temperature that the chip thinks it is at.  The trim
             value is added to the unifiCrystalFrequencyTrim MIB key
             and the resulting value is used to trim the crystal.

             If the chip is at a temperature that exactly matches a
             temperature in this table then the corresponding trim
             value is used.  If the chip is at a temperature between
             two table rows then the trim value is linearly

             temperature is outside the range of the table then the
             value at the end of the table is used.

             (LNA) or antenna switches.  This attribute configures which PIOs
             are used and how they are driven with respect to radio activity.
             The possible values are:

                0 - No PIOs are used to drive external RF circuitry.

                1 - PIO[0] and PIO[1] are driven as follows:

                        Idle        Low     Low     Low

                        Transmit    High    Low   Low/High

                3 - PIO[0], PIO[1] and PIO[8] are driven as follows:

                        Transmit    High    Low   High/Low

             In scheme 2 (txrxlna) a 'Q Receive' is a receive of a
             quiet packet and an 'L Receive' is a receive of a loud
             packet.  Whether UniFi is in the 'quiet' or 'loud'
             mode is determined from the average RSSI of packets
             received 'recently'.  It is assumed that PIO[0] and
             PIO[1] will be used to drive any switches that switch
             between transmit and receive mode.  These signals will
             never both be 'High'.  Any external LNA can be powered
             from PIO[1] and enabled by PIO[8]."

        DESCRIPTION
            "This attribute specifies a front-end control signal configuration
             set for UF602x ICs.  It must comprise of exactly 20 octets.

             Each octet selects the front-end control signal that should be
             output on a given pin.  The first 16 octets correspond to settings
             for PIOs 0 to 15 in that order.  The next two octets correspond to
             settings for pins 2G4TX_EN and 2G4RX_EN.  The last two octets must
             be set to 0x00.

             The value that each octet takes defines the behaviour of the pin,
             with the available options being detailed below.

             It is important to note that a number of the available signals
             incorporate indications of Bluetooth activity.  This information
             can be made available to UniFi in several ways.

             If both unifiCoexPTABTTXEnablePIO and unifiCoexPTABTRXEnablePIO are
             set to valid PIO indices (see the descriptions of those attributes
             for more detail), then transmit and receive enable signals may be
             driven from a collocated Bluetooth device into UniFi giving UniFi
             full knowledge of all Bluetooth activity.

             If this is not possible in a design, UniFi can infer Bluetooth
             activity from coexistence signalling under certain conditions.

             While the former approach can be (and is) implemented using
             combinatorial logic, the latter requires sequential logic and,
             thus, the information available is limited when UniFi is in
             an aggressive power saving state such as deep sleep.  The
             general consequence of this state therefore is that UniFi can
             detect the occurrence of Bluetooth activity, but not the type of
             activity.

             To restate: when using Bluetooth front-end control signals
             derived from coexistence signalling, UniFi cannot distinguish
             between Bluetooth transmit and receive activity when in deep
             sleep.

             This has impact on some of the signals which follow.

             General signals:

             0x00  PIN_UNUSED - This pin is not used for front end control.  If
                   this option is selected then the specified PIO may still be
                   used for a purpose other than front-end control.  It is
                   inadvisable to change a given pin between PIN_UNUSED and
                   other settings in different rows of the table.

             0xf0  DRIVE_LOW - This pin will be driven low.

             0xf1  DRIVE_HIGH - This pin will be driven high.

             Bluetooth-only signals:

             0x10  BT_TX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi has
                   determined that the Bluetooth device is definitely
                   transmitting, and low at all other times.

             0x11  BT_RX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi has
                   determined that the Bluetooth device is definitely
                   receiving, and low at all other times.

             0x12  BT_TXRX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi has
                   determined that the Bluetooth device is either transmitting
                   or receiving.

             0x18  BT_POSSIBLY_TX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi
                   has determined that the Bluetooth device is definitely
                   transmitting, or knows that Bluetooth is active but does
                   not know whether it is transmitting or receiving.

             WLAN 2.4GHz signals:

             0x20  WL2G4_TX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   transmitting on the 2.4GHz band.

             0x21  WL2G4_RX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   receiving on the 2.4GHz band.

             0x22  WL2G4_TXRX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving on the 2.4GHz band.

             0x23  WL2G4_RX_HG_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   receiving on the 2.4GHz and the internal automatic gain
                   control (AGC) algorithm has determined that high gain is
                   required from external front-end components such as a low
                   noise amplifier (LNA).

             0x24  WL2G4_RX_LG_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   receiving on the 2.4GHz and the internal automatic gain
                   control (AGC) algorithm has determined that low gain is
                   required from external front-end components such as a low
                   noise amplifier (LNA).

             0x25  WL2G4_DIV_A - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving on the 2.4GHz band and
                   internal antenna diversity logic selects antenna A.

             0x26  WL2G4_DIV_B - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving on the 2.4GHz band and
                   internal antenna diversity logic selects antenna B.

             WLAN 2.4GHz / Bluetooth signals:

             0x31  WL2G4BT_RX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   receiving on the 2.4GHz band, or has determined that the
                   Bluetooth device is definitely receiving.

             0x33  WL2G4BT_RX_HG_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   receiving on the 2.4GHz band, or has determined that the
                   Bluetooth device is definitely receiving, and the internal
                   automatic gain control (AGC) algorithm has determined that
                   high gain is required from external front-end components such
                   as a low noise amplifier (LNA).

             0x34  WL2G4BT_RX_LG_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   receiving on the 2.4GHz band, or has determined that the
                   Bluetooth device is definitely receiving, and the internal
                   automatic gain control (AGC) algorithm has determined that
                   low gain is required from external front-end components such
                   as a low noise amplifier (LNA).

             0x35  WL2G4_BT_DIV_A - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving on the 2.4GHz band, or
                   has determined that Bluetooth is active, and internal antenna
                   diversity logic selects antenna A.

             0x36  WL2G4_BT_DIV_B - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving on the 2.4GHz band, or
                   has determined that Bluetooth is active, and internal antenna
                   diversity logic selects antenna B.

             0x38  WL2G4_TXRX_BT_RX_EN_n - When UniFi is active (either
                   transmitting or receiving), this pin will be essentially
                   equivalent to BT_TX_EN, ensuring that the Bluetooth device
                   uses the direct path only when transmitting and allowing a
                   signal such as WL2G4BT_RX_EN to be used to control enables
                   for a shared receive path.

                   When UniFi is inactive, this pin will be driven at all times
                   when UniFi has not determined that a Bluetooth reception is
                   occurring.

                   This signal will most often be used to control enables for a
                   direct path from the Bluetooth device to a shared antenna in
                   designs where a pull-up resistor is fitted to ensure
                   Bluetooth will function when UniFi is powered down, and an
                   alternate path is preferred for receive operation when UniFi
                   is active.

                   By driving the signal when UniFi is not active, power
                   dissipated through the pull-up resistor can be minimised.

             WLAN 5GHz signals:

             0x40  WL5G_TX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   transmitting on the 5GHz band.

             0x41  WL5G_RX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   receiving on the 5GHz band.

             0x42  WL5G_TXRX_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving on the 5GHz band.

             0x43  WL5G_RX_HG_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   receiving on the 5GHz and the internal automatic gain
                   control (AGC) algorithm has determined that high gain is
                   required from external front-end components such as a low
                   noise amplifier (LNA).

             0x44  WL5G_RX_LG_EN - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   receiving on the 5GHz and the internal automatic gain
                   control (AGC) algorithm has determined that low gain is
                   required from external front-end components such as a low
                   noise amplifier (LNA).

             0x45  WL5G_DIV_A - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving on the 5GHz band and
                   internal antenna diversity logic selects antenna A.

             0x46  WL5G_DIV_B - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving on the 5GHz band and
                   internal antenna diversity logic selects antenna B.

             WLAN band-independent signals:

             0x65  WL_DIV_A - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is either
                   transmitting or receiving regardless of band, and internal
                   antenna diversity logic selects antenna A.

             0x66  WL_DIV_B - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is either
                   transmitting or receiving regardless of band, and internal
                   antenna diversity logic selects antenna B.

             WLAN / Bluetooth signals:

             0x75  WLBT_DIV_A - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving regardless of band, or has
                   determined that Bluetooth is active, and internal antenna
                   diversity logic selects antenna A.

             0x76  WLBT_DIV_B - This pin will be driven high when UniFi is
                   either transmitting or receiving regardless of band, or has
                   determined that Bluetooth is active, and internal antenna
                   diversity logic selects antenna A.

             Restrictions:

             The are some restrictions on configuration - not all signals are
             available on all PIOs, and some combinations of signals may not
             be supported simultaneously.

             The settings for PIOs 0 to 7 must be PIN_UNUSED.

             The settings for the dedicated UF602x pins 2G4TX_EN and 2G4RX_EN
             are slightly less restricted.  These two pins may only be used for
             DRIVE_LOW and DRIVE_HIGH, and additionally WL2G4_TX_EN for the
             former, and WL2G4_RX_EN and WL2G4BT_RX_EN for the latter.

             PIOs 8 to 15 may be assigned any of the available functions.

             Certain signals, namely BT_TX_EN and WL2G4_TXRX_BT_RX_EN_n,
             will only be driven correctly if
             unifiFrontEndControlMutualExclusion is set such that Bluetooth
             transmission and WLAN 2.4GHz reception are mutually exclusive."

             and can be set to one of the following collision type values:
                 00b - No collision
                 01b - Collision: WLAN RX / BT TX
                 10b - Collision: WLAN TX / BT RX
                 11b - Collision: WLAN TX / BT TX

             Example:
                 To specify that only in-band TX vs RX situations are to be
                 regarded as collisions, set bits 9:8 to 10b, and bits 5:4
                 to 01b.  The two octets would then be: 0x02 0x10

             The remainder of the octet string consists of two consecutive
             identically structured sets of data, each 13 octets in length.
             The first group of 13 octets controls arbitration of requests
             from the WLAN, and the second group applies to requests from
             Bluetooth.

             The first 12 octets of each group contain the arbiter thresholds.
             Each octet corresponds to a certain activity combination as shown
             below, where (HP) indicates a high-priority activity and (LP)
             indicates low-priority:
                 octet  1  -  WLAN RX (LP) / BT TX (LP)
                 octet  2  -  WLAN RX (LP) / BT TX (HP)
                 octet  3  -  WLAN RX (HP) / BT TX (LP)
                 octet  4  -  WLAN RX (HP) / BT TX (HP)
                 octet  5  -  WLAN TX (LP) / BT RX (LP)
                 octet  6  -  WLAN TX (LP) / BT RX (HP)
                 octet  7  -  WLAN TX (HP) / BT RX (LP)
                 octet  8  -  WLAN TX (HP) / BT RX (HP)
                 octet  9  -  WLAN TX (LP) / BT TX (LP)
                 octet 10  -  WLAN TX (LP) / BT TX (HP)
                 octet 11  -  WLAN TX (HP) / BT TX (LP)
                 octet 12  -  WLAN TX (HP) / BT TX (HP)

             When a request is issued, the arbiter generates a 5-bit
             pseudo-random number (0-31) and compares this to the threshold
             specified in the table for the requested activity combination.
             If the random number is less-than the threshold then the
             requested activity is allowed, otherwise it is denied.

             Hence a threshold value of 0 will always result in requests being
             denied, 32 will always result in requests being allowed, and
             intermediate values will give varying probabilities of request
             being allowed.  The most significant two bits of each octet shall
             be set to zero.

             Example:
                 To set the Bluetooth arbiter thresholds so that:
                   - All Bluetooth receives are allowed;
                   - High-priority Bluetooth transmissions are always allowed;
                   - Low-priority Bluetooth transmissions are deferred during
                     high-priority WLAN activity;
                   - Low-priority Bluetooth transmissions are allowed 50% of
                     the time during low-priority WLAN activity.
                 The threshold part of the octet string would be set to:
                 0x10 0x20 0x00 0x20 0x20 0x20 0x20 0x20 0x10 0x20 0x00 0x20

             The final octet of each group contains the abort masks for that
             technology.  Setting bits in the abort mask allows new requests
             on the other technology to abort previously allowed requests on
             this technology given that the arbiter rules in their favour:

                 bits 7:6 - Reserved.  Always set to 0.

                 bits 5:2 - Restrict abort behaviour (as specified by bits 1:0)
                            to particular priority combinations:
                                        This           Other
                                bit 5 - High-priority  High-priority
                                bit 4 - High-priority  Low-priority
                                bit 3 - Low-priority   High-priority
                                bit 2 - Low-priority   Low-priority

                 bits 1:0 - Set to cause receive (bit 0) or transmit (bit 1)
                            activities on the other technology to abort an
                            activity by this technology.

             Example:
                 To abort a low priority activity when the other technology
                 attempts a high priority transmission, set bits 1 and 3
                 giving an octet value of: 0x0a

             Three default entries are provided in the table:

                 1 - No front-end overload; full simultaneous operation is
                     possible on non-overlapping (out-of-band) frequencies.

                 2 - Front-end overload makes any simultaneous operation
                     unreliable; time-division operation is desirable.

                 3 - A single antenna is switched between both radios;
                     strict time-division sharing of the antenna is essential.

             The default entries can be modified during system operation,
             but cannot be deleted.  An attempt to delete one of the default
             rows will restore the default settings for that row.  Additional
             rows may be freely created or deleted.  The arbitration behaviour
             is only updated with new settings when unifiCoexCollisionSelection

        DESCRIPTION
            "This attribute controls the coexistence priorities used for
             WLAN activity on UF602x ICs.  The format of the attribute is an
             octet string where each consecutive pair of octets describes
             the priorities that should be used for a given radio activity or
             state.

             The octets within the string are assigned as follows.

              0-1    Transmission of a data frame in AC_BK.
              2-3    Transmission of a data frame in AC_BE.

              10-11  Transmission of a control frame.
              12-13  Transmission of an IEEE 802.11 broadcast or
                     multicast frame.
              14-15  Expected beacon reception.
              16-17  ATIM window in IBSS.
              18-19  Active and passive scan.
              20-21  U-APSD down-link triggered.
              22-23  PS-Poll exchange in progress.
              24-25  Broadcast or multicast traffic expected.
              26-27  Power management mode change in progress.

             Priorities for each activity may be fixed, or generated
             pseudo-randomly by UniFi according to a specified distribution.
             The first octet of each pair within the string controls the type
             and parameters of distribution used.

             The most significant nibble of this octet specifies the
             distribution to be used and also dictates the format of the second
             octet in each pair.  The available options are:

              0 - Normal distribution.  Priorities chosen are normally
                  distributed with a given variance around a mean value.  The
                  mean is specified as the least significant nibble (bits 3 down
                  to 0) of the second octet, and the variance is specified as
                  the next most significant three bits (bits 6 down to 4).

                  Only variances in the range 0 to 5 are supported.  Specified
                  variances greater than 5 will treated as if they were equal to
                  5.  A variance of zero will result in the priority being fixed
                  at the specified mean value.

              1 - Uniform distribution.  Priorities within a specified range are
                  chosen with equal probability.  The minimum value of the range
                  is specified as the most significant nibble (bits 7 down to 4)
                  of the second octet, with the maximum value of the range
                  specified as the least significant nibble (bits 3 down to 0).

                  If the specified minimum value is greater than the specified
                  maximum value then the smaller of the two will be used as a
                  fixed priority.

              2 - Saw tooth distribution.  Priorities within a specified range
                  are chosen with a probability mass function in the shape of a
                  saw tooth, that is, probability greatest at one end of the
                  range, and linearly decreasing to zero at the priority one
                  beyond the other end of the range.

                  The point of the saw tooth (that is, the end of the range at
                  which the probability mass function should take a maximum
                  value) is specified as the least significant nibble (bits 3
                  down to 0) of the second octet, and the tail of the saw tooth
                  (that is, the end of the range beyond which the probability
                  mass function should reach zero) is specified as the most
                  significant nibble (bits 7 down to 4).

              3 - Fixed value.  This provides a fixed priority in the
                  least significant nibble (bits 3 down to 0).  With this
                  option only bit 3 of the flags, described below, will have
                  any effect.

             In all cases, unused bits in either octet should be set to zero.

             Further to the described mechanisms, the first octet of each pair
             also contains (in the least significant bits) flags which allow
             selected priority values to be further constrained.  Specifically,
             these flags allow priorities generated for a given activity or
             state to be constrained to being either odd or even in order to
             maintain mutual exclusion with priorities specified for other
             transceivers in the system.

             This functionality is enabled if the least significant bit (bit 0)
             of the first octet of each pair is non-zero.  In this case, the
             selection of whether even or odd priorities are to be used is made
             using the next least significant bit (bit 1) of the same octet.  If
             bit 1 is 1 then only odd priorities will be used for the
             corresponding activity or state; if bit 1 is 0 then only even
             priorities will be used.

             Bit 2 of the octet controls the rounding direction used when a
             priority is to be rounded to nearest even or odd value.  If bit 2
             is 1 then priorities of undesired parity will be incremented; if
             bit 2 is 0 then priorities of undesired parity will be decremented.

             Bit 3 of the octet controls whether the protection is enabled or
             disabled.  This bit is only used for protection types, octets 14
             through 27.  All transmission octets are always enabled.

             In all cases, priorities will saturate at the bounds of the
             priority range - 0 and 15.

             Changes to this MIB attribute take effect when unifiCoexScheme is
             next written."

            "In the IEEE 802.11 specification, there is no way for the host
             to control the rate at which data is transmitted.  Usually UniFi
             will apply its own channel-quality-driven algorithm.  This
             attribute allows the transmit rate for unicast data to be set
             directly.  This is not usually useful in normal operation.  The
             values is specified in units of 500kbit/s; a value of 0
             indicates that the standard algorithm should be used.  Management
             and broadcast frames are not controlled by this mechanism as
             they must be sent at a rate in the basic rate set.  If the rate
             is not supported by the hardware or the remote station, the next
             lower data rate is used.  The lowest data rate is used for
             values from 1 to the lowest supported data rate.

             Reading the value of the attribute provides the rate configured
             in the hardware (or zero if none), rather than the rate
             originally requested.

             Note that the data rate may be increased beyond the requested
             value to avoid violations of the minimum data rate requirement
             when using the relevant quality of service enhancements from
             WMM or the IEEE 802.11e standard.

             When the IEEE 802.11n standard (High Throughput extensions) is
             in use, setting the data rate to values outside the Modulation
             and Coding Scheme rates is likely to be problematic as certain
             features, in particular A-MPDU frame format, requires an MCS
             rate to be used.
